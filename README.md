Professional Content Management tools

## Why another CMS framework?
Most Content Management tools are created to be used by people developing content with little or no experance with building web sites. This is great for blogs and small business websites but starts to breakdown when the uses wants to add ecommerse, advertising, search engine optimazation or mailing list automization. As sites grow to need these features inevitably they contact  professionals to add on to what they already have in place. Then instead of using the indsustry standard solutions the  professional has to learn how to shoehorn a fix into the selected CMS. Or in the case to the larger more well known CMS tools install / write a module.
